        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
        the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
        dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
        should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized
        across Web browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in
        levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now
        split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.
